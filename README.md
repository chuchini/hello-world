# hello-world
First repository.

This repository will be a "Notes Repository", that means that I will put every note related to differents projects in this place. It will be a general description of every project located here at GitHub.

About me:

I'm currently studing computer science at UNAM. Enthusiast of photography and sooner it will be my main hobby. There are other hobbies like playing the piano (although I don't play it very well). I'm planning to run my own company with some friends pretty soon.
